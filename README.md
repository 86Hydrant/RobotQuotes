# RobotQuotes
Made as a project for a 2 week section of Hyper Island module Exploring Code!

## Some Side Notes
At the time of making this project I had barely touched machine learning or AI's. Therefore the quotes displayed are not coming directly
From the AI writer, but from an array of 100+ quotes I copied from the AI, made in a Google Colab notebook found here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FB2bYvUGRLPmqtuvq5FP0hlH2OfpaG5U#scrollTo=DCcx5u7sbPTD

I trained it using 4000+ quotes I fetched from an API and separated into plain text. 

The tools used were vanilla JS, with voice and visuals from p5.js
